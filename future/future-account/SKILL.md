# Account

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when the user asks to:
- Check their account profile or user information
- View their credit balance or remaining credits
- Create a recharge / top-up order
- Ask "how is my account" or "show me my balance"

## Commands

### View account profile

```bash
future account profile
```

Returns: user ID, email, email verification status, registration date.

### View credit balance

```bash
future account balance
```

Returns: balance in credits. Use `--json` for machine-readable output.

### Create recharge order

```bash
future account recharge --amount 10 --channel alipay
```

- `--amount <yuan>` (required): recharge amount in CNY (e.g., `10` = ¥10.00). Range: 1–10,000.
- `--channel <alipay|wechat>` (required): payment channel.

Returns: order number, amount, channel, status (`pending`), pay URL, expiration time.

## Pricing

All account commands are **free** (zero credits). They do not consume any balance.

## Notes

- Account data (user profile, wallet balance) is per-user and identified by the API key.
- Recharge orders start as `pending` and must be completed through the payment provider. The CLI does not handle payment execution — it only creates the order.
- The recharge amount unit is **yuan** (CNY), not cents.
