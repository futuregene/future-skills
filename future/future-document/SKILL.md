# Document Parse

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when the user asks to:
- Parse, extract text from, or convert a PDF or Word document
- Extract tables, formulas, or structured content from a document
- Convert a document to Markdown format
- Read or analyze the content of a document file
- 解析PDF / 提取文档内容 / 转换Word / 文档转markdown / 读取PDF内容

**If the user mentions any of the above, stop what you're doing and use this skill.** Do not try to use other PDF tools or libraries — use the tool below.

## How to use

Call via the `future` CLI using the `bash` tool. Use `doc_path` to point to the file — the CLI reads and encodes it automatically:

```bash
# Parse a document by path — no base64 needed
future tools call parse_doc --args '{"doc_path": "/path/to/document.pdf"}'
```

**Always use `doc_path` instead of `doc_b64`.** The CLI handles file reading and base64 encoding.
